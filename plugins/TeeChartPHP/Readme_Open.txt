Thank you for download the TeeChart for PHP Version 2019 Open Source Free.

If you plan on using TeeChart for PHP in a commercial context you will need to acquire the professional license. Commercial use is 
for example if you use TeeChart on a site to provide a service for paying customers or for example if you are using it in an intranet 
to provide support for internal business processes, i.e. in benefit for a commercial company.

In short, if you use TeeChart where you have an economic advantage (either through paying customers or improving internal business 
processes) this most likely falls under commercial use. 

Please check the License document included into the zip file.

Please read Install.txt file which includes all the instructions to be able to use the TeeChart for PHP components under PHP directly 
or throught several PHP IDEs.
