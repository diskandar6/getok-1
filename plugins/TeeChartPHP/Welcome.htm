<H2><A NAME="INTRO">1. Introduction</A></H2>
 The purpose of this guide is to highlight the resources that are available to help you work with TeeChart for 
PHP. All TeeChart technical information is now available in electronic format only. Electronic format brings obvious advantages such as word search, portability and speed.
<P>There are now many sources of information for TeeChart, of which some contain duplicity or variants on the same theme and some are better than others at answering differing types of questions. To clarify it all, this guide is the roadmap.</P>
<P>We have tried to minimize the effect of obsolescence of content by putting the information in as generically as possible, as a guide to information sources. We hope it is of use.</P>
<B><P>Thanks for using TeeChart for PHP !!</P></B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>


<H3><A NAME="INSTALL">TeeChart Installation</a></H3>
<P>All versions of TeeChart for PHP are delivered in a single zip file. 
Extracting the contents of this file you will find a JAR file which includes the 
sources of TeeChart for PHP, it needs to be executed in order to extract all the 
sources into a \sources folder. The zip file also contains the Help and Demo 
files.</P>

<H2><A NAME="WHERE">3. Where to look for help</A></H2>
<P>There are several sources of help available to users of TeeChart for PHP. This area is important to an understanding of where to look and can save a great deal of time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="CODE">Code completion</A></H3>
<P>The native code prompter in nearly all professional PHP programming environments will show all properties and methods available for any TeeChart class. Simply type in the start of the programming line and on typing the point separator all available Class options will appear. For properties and methods, required variables and their type will be displayed.</P>

<H3><br>
<A NAME="EXAMPLES">TeeChart Examples</A></H3>
<P>Coded examples can be accessed under the 'Demos' folder in the TeeChart for 
PHP installation folder. There are two principle example projects under the Features and 
VCLforPHP folders, the first only uses PHP code and second is a demostration of 
using TeeChart for PHP within the Delphi for PHP IDE.</P>
<P>A useful way to get help from the examples is to take a look a the source 
code of the demo itself, you can see it just by cliking over the &quot;view source&quot; 
link (for Features Demo).</P>

<H3><br>
<A NAME="TUTORIALS">Tutorials</A></H3>
<P>HTML Tutorials contain a guide to use of the key areas of TeeChart for PHP’s  component libraries. Tutorials can be accessed under the 'Docs\Tutorials' under the TeeChart for 
PHP installation folder. We recommend you take a look at the Tutorials as early as 
possible to familiarize yourself with the information available: you will 
probably find some useful tips there when you come to start working with 
projects. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H2><A NAME="GLOSSARY">4. Glossary of TeeChart for PHP key terminology</A></H2>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
 
<H3><A NAME="AXIS">Axis</A></H3>
<P><B>Basic Chart Axes</B></P>
<P>Axes refer to the scales that can be placed on the Chart to orientate the data. In standard terms these  
Axes have either an X, Y or Z component as in the diagram below.</P>
<P><CENTER><img src="Docs/Images/image007.png" width="53" height="74"></P></CENTER>
<P>TeeChart has five principal axes, Left, Top, Right, Bottom and Depth. Different data Series can be related  
to different Axes permitting different Axis scales for these Series on the same Chart.</P>
<UL><LI>Left and Right Axes refer to a Y-Axis</LI>
<LI>Top and Bottom Axes refer to an X-Axis</LI>
<LI>The Depth Axis refers to the Z-Axis</LI></UL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Multiple Axes</B></P>
<P>TeeChart for PHP offers true multiple Axes at runtime. Multiple Axes permit an independently scaled  
Axis to be placed anywhere on the Chart with any Start/Finish point.</P>
<P>The following diagram shows an example of the use of multi-axes:</P>
<P><CENTER><img src="Docs/Images/image008.png" width="345" height="213"></P></CENTER>
<P>Look up Axes in the online help file for a full list of properties and methods and an overview of  
functionality.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="CANVAS">Canvas</A></H3>
<P><B><A NAME="PRINCIPLE">Principal Canvases</B></A></P>
<P>TeeChart uses several Canvases. Principal canvases include: </P>
<UL><LI>Chart Canvas, which is the visible Area enclosed by the Chart Panel boundary. All Chart Axes and data  
are plotted on the Chart Canvas.</LI>
</UL>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><A NAME="CUSTOM">Custom drawing on the Chart canvas</B></A></P>
<P>If you require a feature that we haven't added to the standard TeeChart properties and methods then, with  
almost unlimited flexibility, you can add it yourself using the TeeChart Custom draw Canvas methods. Custom  
draw permits you to output your own objects and text to the Chart panel associating them with runtime  
variables and Chart conditions. These could take the form of hints on passing a mouse over a data Series  
object or a message triggered by a threshold exceeded. The Custom Canvas also supports a variety of 3D  
objects.</P>
<P><CENTER><img src="Docs/Images/image009.png" width="203" height="237"></P></CENTER>
<P>Look up Canvas in the online help file for a full list of properties and methods and an overview of  
functionality.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><A NAME="CHOOSING">Choosing a different Canvas for displaying the Chart.</B></A></P>
<P>The basic (default) TeeChart Canvas is suitable for fast 2D and 3D (orthogonal) plots. </P>
<P><CENTER><img src="Docs/Images/image010.png" width="453" height="296"></P></CENTER>
<P>Fig. Main Chart Components</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="PANEL">Chart Panel</A></H3>
<P>The Chart panel is the backdrop to the Chart. If TeeChart is laid bare of all contents, e.g. 'Visible off'  
for all Charting components, it makes a perfectly serviceable 3D panel.</P>
<P>Lookup TChart in the online help file for a full list of properties and methods  and an overview of functionality.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="RECTANGLE">Chart Rectangle</A></H3>
<P>The Charting area: This is the area contained within the principle 5 Chart axes (Left, Top, Right, Bottom  
and Depth). The Chart data Series and Grid are plotted inside the Chart rectangle.</P>
<P>Some Chart Series types do not require and do not install by default any axes. Setting the Chart Frame to visible enables the Chart rectangle to be highlighted by the selected colour. </P>
<P>Look up TChart in the online help file for a full list of properties and methods and an overview of  
functionality.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="DATASOURCE">Datasource</A></H3>
<P>The Datasource for a Chart refers to database sourced data. For the PHP version of TeeChart the sources include 
RecordSets. Non-Datasource sources for data are defined by the TeeChart developer via code using TeeChart's Add methods to add data programmatically to the Chart.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="FUNCTIONS">Functions</A></H3>
<P>TeeChart offers several basic functions such as Average, Moving Average and Curve Fit. The function may use another Chart Series as input for its point plot. Functions are added as Line Series type by default but may optionally be changed to a different visualization such as a Bar Series or Point Series.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="LEGEND">Legend</A></H3>
<P>The Legend has four default positioning options, Left, Top, Right and Bottom but you may move the Legend to place it anywhere on the Chart Panel including inside the Chart rectangle. The Legend has many supporting properties and events to allow customization and/or interactive display.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="MARKS">Marks</A></H3>
<P>Marks refer to the Labels associated with each data point of a Series. Marks may be displayed in several ways; as the data value, as a text description of the point or as a percentage related to the value of all points taken as a whole. Marks are normally displayed alongside, above or below the Series point. An alternative and complementary data related labeling scheme is the Axis Labels which label key scale points on the Axis. Marks may be repositioned and their properties modified at runtime.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="ORTHOGONAL">Orthogonal 3D</A></H3>
<P>Orthogonal 3D Charts use the default Chart Canvas to plot an angled, vector drawn line to represent a 3D  
angle (depth). This gives a basic level of 3D visual appearance whilst remaining very fast for data plots.  
See the TeeChart documentation for more about TeeChart Canvases and the alternative Windows 3D and OpenGL  
canvases.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="PAGING">Paging</A></H3>
<P>TeeCharts may optionally be subdivided into several Chart pages. This helps visualization of large data  
sets or may be useful for 'time dividing' screens of data. Pages may be browsed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="SERIES">Series</A></H3>
<P>Data Series are the data display method type, e.g. Line Series, Bar Series, Pie, etc. You can mix  
different Series types in a Chart according to your requirement. Thus your design is not limited to any  
'Chart types' defined by TeeChart, the concept of Chart type being virtually obsolete in terms of the number  
of permutations of Charts (Series type mix) you may create.</P>
<P>Look up Series in the online help file for a full list of properties and methods and an overview of  
functionality.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="TITLES">Titles</A></H3>
<P>Use TeeChart's Title properties to add Header and Footer titles to the Chart, Axis titles and data Series  
Titles. Custom draw permits you to add additional titles anywhere on the Chart Canvas.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="WALLS">Walls</A></H3>
<P>The Chart Walls are boundaries that can be placed at the side, bottom and back of the Chart Rectangle to  
accentuate the Charted area. Chart walls are a visual component not containing any data scale related  
information. TeeChart for PHP has four Walls, Left, Right, Bottom and Back. Each Wall may be coloured and changed dimensionally.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="TOOLS">Chart Tools</A></H3>
<P>TeeChart Tools may be associated with a Chart, Series or Axes to facilitate annotation, navigation and  
data demarcation. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
